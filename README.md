# Singleplayerstate
Singleplayerstate (A.K.A MinimalistLauncher) is my take on a BSG-inspired launcher for the SPT community, and it serves one purpose with some extras:

### Launch Tarkov seamlessly.

## Installing
- Download the tool from the [SPT workshop](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/1663-minimalist-launcher/).
- Extract the `MinimalistLauncher` folder to any location (do NOT install it into Desktop or Program Files/Program Files (x86).
- Open the folder and open `MinimalistLauncher.exe`.
- - Alternatively, launch `Start Launcher.bat` directly.

## Missing features
- Disable the play button in case any of the existing critical SPT files are not detected. Just play nice, ok?

## Features
Currently, there are a handful of features implemented. I have not planned more, but unplanned changes may occur, and I reserve the right to implement any.

- List-based system for SPT installation folders. This includes a nickname-based system that lets you name your installs.
- Shortcuts to cache, my [LOE](https://hub.sp-tarkov.com/files/file/1082-loe-load-order-editor) tool, various mod folders, and the server folder itself.
- Selection for launcher behavior: `Do nothing`, `Minimize launcher`, `Minimize to tray`.
- - `Minimize launcher` will, as it says, minimize the launcher when the SPT Server runs. It will also pop the launcher back up on close.
- Selection for on-quit behavior: `Do nothing`, `Display launcher`, `Close launcher`.
- Fancy account selector: When a profile is selected, its name and profile ID will display in separate boxes.
- - The nickname can easily be changed via the `Set` button next to the textbar.
- - An incomplete profile will display as `Incomplete profile`
- [PLANNED]: Separate start and close Server feature: Allow the user to restart server without closing Tarkov.
